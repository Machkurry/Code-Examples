# Final-Projects
This project was a text based adventure game made for C++. 
It allows for players to load, save and create new characters in
a classic text based adventure. The user is prompted to choose a skill to test against.
The test consists of "rolling" a dice through using a random number generator and comparing it
against the modified stat. If the stat is equal to or higher than the original stat, the test fails.
Download and modify to your heart's content. Hope this helps with any endeavors in C++!
